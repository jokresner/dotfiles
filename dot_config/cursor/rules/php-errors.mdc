# Errors & Exceptions
- Never suppress errors with @.
- Throw domain-specific exceptions; do not return error strings.
- Catch only what you can handle; rethrow with previous exception.
- Use Value Objects for validation; avoid silent defaults.
- Log unexpected exceptions once at the edge (middleware/handler).
