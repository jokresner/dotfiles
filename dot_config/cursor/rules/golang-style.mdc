# Go Code Style Rules
- Always run `gofmt` or `goimports` before committing.
- Follow Go naming conventions:
  - Exported identifiers: PascalCase.
  - Unexported identifiers: camelCase.
- Keep line length <= 100 characters.
- Group standard library imports first, then third-party, then local modules.
- Avoid unnecessary abbreviations in variable names.
- Use `error` as the last return value in functions.
- Prefer `context.Context` as the first argument in long-lived or external-facing funcs.
