# Auto Document Session (Work/Private)

- Ask me which Anytype space: **Work Journal** or **Private Journal**.
- Use **@Git** to gather staged diffs/commit messages and **@Past Chats** for today’s key exchanges.
- Summarize as Markdown sections:
  1) Date & Context
  2) Git Changes
  3) Cursor Interaction Summary
  4) Completed Work
  5) Pending Work / Next Steps
- Using the Anytype MCP, **create or append** to the daily page titled `YYYY-MM-DD` in the chosen space. If missing, create it; then append the entry (separate entries with `---`).
